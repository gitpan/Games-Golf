Revision history for Perl extension Games::Golf.

0.14  Tue May 14 2002

A lot of things have changed several times since 0.13...
So many, in fact, that we had to break the Changes in several sections
and add credits (in fact the owners of the items in the TODO)

This should be a working version with no limits yet, supporting only
single hole courses. Working on Unix and Windows. Ready for the public.

   * Internals [jep/book]
        - A whole new TestSuite architecture, based around the capture()
          method
        - capture() is based on various implementations, that depend on
          the OS (Unix, Windows, etc.). All these are named _capture_xxx
        - _capture_unix()
        - _capture_unix_nolimit() is a minimal Unix capture method,
          which capture() uses when no limit is required
        - _capture_nolimit() is a minimal capture method, that can
          capture STDERR or not. It is called by _capture_unix_nolimit,
          _capture_winnt_nolimit and _capture_win9x_nolimit.
        - _capture_win9x_nolimit carps about not being able to capture stderr
   * Games::Golf [jquelin]
        - code cleaning in Games::Golf (both code and interface)
        - new method GG::_parse_config_file() (just a stub for now,
          but will be a placeholder for later) to read config file
        - GG has a working cache
   * Games::Golf::Entry [jquelin]
        - cut out in GGE: author&nick attributes redundant, nick has gone
        - date is stored as seconds since epoch
        - new method GGE::id()
        - new method GGE::date_string()
   * Games::Golf::TestSuite
        - changed the GGT interface so that the constructor only accept
          a code string, rather than a filename [book]
        - fixed several bugs due to the interface of capture() and
          _capture_xxx() [jep/book]
        - removed POSIX tmpnam, and used File::Temp instead [book]
   * Games::Golf::OS [book]
        - this new module exports a few methods to help OS detection
   * scripts/golf [jquelin]
        - rewritten from scratch
        - basic reading / testing / outputing / caching
   * Tests [book]
        - moved all the t/hole* snippets of testsuite code into the
          t/Sweeties.pm file, that exports a hash holding all the
          snippets
        - tests for all the _capture_xxx methods, GGOS, and others
        - added tpr02.glf and tpr03.glf (multi-hole) sample test files
   * General [smueller]
        - remove the looong authors lists, and create an AUTHORS file
          (except in Golf.pm, the main file)
        - fix the pod in many places
