Revision history for Perl extension Games::Golf.

0.15  Sat Jun  1 2002

   * Internals
        - removed all non-essential non-core modules younger than 5.005
          (i.e. replaced File::Temp back by POSIX tmpnam) [book]
        - implement the correct stderr capture for win9x [amir/book]
   * Games::Golf
        - _parse_config_file parses the .glf file to create GGT objects,
          fetch the configuration data, etc [jquelin/book]
        - accessors to return configuration data (version, pgas) [book]
        - parsing of tiebreaker section in .glf files [smueller]
        - default tiebreaker/version/name in .glf files [book]
   * Games::Golf::Entry
        - made id() a method, rather than an accessor
        - removed all tiebreaker code from GGE [book]
        - added a version attribute, corresponding to the test version
   * Games::Golf::TestSuite [book]
        - changed new to accept the testsuite code as the only argument
        - add a new loop method that runs aioee on many sets of args
        - accessors to set/getconfiguration data (id, type, version, name)
        - 'type' is used to know if we are testing a script or a sub
          => compile and makesub are called automatically by check()
             which abort the testsuite (result 0/1) if it breaks
        - the version string from the .glf file is used by run() to test
          if theGGE was tested against the current testsuite
   * Tests [book]
        - t/41tcheck.t now tests something
        - t/50gaccess.t (GG new and accessors)
        - t/55golf.t (general use of GG)
        - more tests on Games::Golf interface
   * Web site
        - http://www.mongueurs.net/projets/games-golf/ offers all the
          previous releases of Games-Golf, as well as an hourly CVS snapshot

0.14a Wed May 15 2002
        - Corrected a slight pod bug that prevented search.cpan.org
          to extract Games::Golf::TestSuite's documentation

0.14  Tue May 14 2002

A lot of things have changed several times since 0.13...
So many, in fact, that we had to break the Changes in several sections
and add credits (in fact the owners of the items in the TODO)

This should be a working version with no limits yet, supporting only
single hole courses. Working on Unix and Windows. Ready for the public.

   * Internals [jep/book]
        - A whole new TestSuite architecture, based around the capture()
          method
        - capture() is based on various implementations, that depend on
          the OS (Unix, Windows, etc.). All these are named _capture_xxx
        - _capture_unix()
        - _capture_unix_nolimit() is a minimal Unix capture method,
          which capture() uses when no limit is required
        - _capture_nolimit() is a minimal capture method, that can
          capture STDERR or not. It is called by _capture_unix_nolimit,
          _capture_winnt_nolimit and _capture_win9x_nolimit.
        - _capture_win9x_nolimit carps about not being able to capture stderr
   * Games::Golf [jquelin]
        - code cleaning in Games::Golf (both code and interface)
        - new method GG::_parse_config_file() (just a stub for now,
          but will be a placeholder for later) to read config file
        - GG has a working cache
   * Games::Golf::Entry [jquelin]
        - cut out in GGE: author&nick attributes redundant, nick has gone
        - date is stored as seconds since epoch
        - new method GGE::id()
        - new method GGE::date_string()
   * Games::Golf::TestSuite
        - changed the GGT interface so that the constructor only accept
          a code string, rather than a filename [book]
        - fixed several bugs due to the interface of capture() and
          _capture_xxx() [jep/book]
        - removed POSIX tmpnam, and used File::Temp instead [book]
   * Games::Golf::OS [book]
        - this new module exports a few methods to help OS detection
   * scripts/golf [jquelin]
        - rewritten from scratch
        - basic reading / testing / outputing / caching
   * Tests [book]
        - moved all the t/hole* snippets of testsuite code into the
          t/Sweeties.pm file, that exports a hash holding all the
          snippets
        - tests for all the _capture_xxx methods, GGOS, and others
        - added tpr02.glf and tpr03.glf (multi-hole) sample test files
   * General [smueller]
        - remove the looong authors lists, and create an AUTHORS file
          (except in Golf.pm, the main file)
        - fix the pod in many places
