README for module Games::Golf
=============================

The game of Perl golf is becoming increasingly popular. Holes frequently
appear on Perl Monks, the Perl Review has an ongoing Perl Golf colunm,
and the Fun with Perl mailing-list has run several very successful
courses in the last few months, with great success.

Until now, judges have had to write extensive test programs to check and
score the players' entries along with compiling the leaderboard by hand.

This module aims at facilitating the administration of Perl golf courses
by writing a simple configuration file and writing the test programs as
a suite of very simple tests.
