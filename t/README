The big t/ directory
--------------------

Games::Golf is relatively large and complex.  Internally we go several
layers deep to implement some high level methods.  All method
dependencies of any particular method must be tested first.

The various test files are split in several sections, and are numbered
to ensure they run in the preferred order.  The sections are:

Basic:
 00-09 - Basic stuff

Internals:
 10-19 - Low-level I/O and internals
         (this is where platform-dependant code is tested)
 20-29 - Internal API
         (mainly the Games::Golf::TestSuite::capture() method)

Modules:
 30-39 - Games::Golf::Entry
 40-49 - Games::Golf::TestSuite
 50-59 - Games::Golf

Integration:
 90-99 - Testing the whole framework


The boring details

 * 14unix.t      - Low-level GGT methods: _capture_unix()

 * 25capture.t   - GGT internal API methods: capture()

Modules:
 * 30eaccess.t   - Games::Golf::Entry methods: new() and accessors.
 * 31escore.t    - Games::Golf::Entry methods: score()
 * 31etiebreak.t - Games::Golf::Entry methods: tiebreak()
 * 32eok.t       - Games::Golf::Entry methods: ok()
